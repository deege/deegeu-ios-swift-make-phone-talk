# How to make iPhone apps talk using text to speech

The purpose of this repository is to supplement the video with code, and to provide a simple starting point to make iPhone apps talk using text to speech.

The AVSpeechSynthesizer is a class that takes text, and produces speech. If we're looking to add speech for maybe a dozen or so things in our app, we're probably better off recording normal human voices. If we have lots of dynamic things we want the phone to say from text, and we want it to sound like a robot, AVSpeechSynthesizer is where we want to be.

## Getting started

The code is a self contained Swift project that can be loaded into XCode.

This code is written and compiled for Swift 2.0.
